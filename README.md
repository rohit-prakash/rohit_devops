# Minikube lab setup with auto-deployment using Terraform and Helm
Objective:

The objective of this task is to use Terraform to set up the infrastructure, including Minikube, Helm, and configure Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for a dummy microservice deployed on Kubernetes.

Requirements:

Minikube installed and configured
Helm installed
Kubernetes knowledge
Basic understanding of microservice architecture
Terraform installed

Steps:
Set up Infrastructure with Terraform:

Define Terraform configuration files to provision the infrastructure required for Minikube.
Use Terraform to create the necessary resources, including virtual machines or containers for Minikube, network configurations, and any dependencies required.
Install and Configure Minikube:

Integrate Minikube setup within Terraform configuration files.
Ensure Minikube is installed and configured correctly as part of the Terraform provisioning process.

Install Helm:

Use Terraform provisioners or external scripts to install Helm on the provisioned Minikube environment.
Verify Helm installation and initialization within the Terraform setup.
Prepare the Dummy Microservice:

Create a basic dummy microservice application.
Containerize the microservice and create a Dockerfile for building the container image.
Push the microservice container image to a registry accessible to your Kubernetes cluster.
Set up Helm Chart for the Microservice:

Define a Helm chart for deploying the dummy microservice onto Kubernetes.
Parameterize the Helm chart appropriately to make it configurable and integrable with Terraform.
Deploy the Microservice using Helm:

Use Terraform to deploy the microservice onto the provisioned Minikube Kubernetes cluster using Helm.
Verify the successful deployment of the microservice pods within the Terraform environment.

Configure Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA):

Analyze performance metrics of the microservice to determine appropriate scaling thresholds.
Set up a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for the microservice Deployment using Kubernetes manifest files within Terraform.
Define scaling policies based on CPU or custom metrics (if available) within the Terraform configuration.

Test HPA Functionality:

Generate load or traffic to the microservice to trigger scaling events.
Monitor the behavior of the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler as it adjusts the number of replicas based on the workload within the Terraform environment.
Document the Setup:

Document the Terraform configuration files used to set up Minikube, Helm, and configure the HPA.
Include any troubleshooting tips or considerations encountered during the setup process.
Provide clear instructions for future reference or for team members who might need to replicate the setup using Terraform.

Deliverables:

Terraform configuration files for provisioning the infrastructure and setting up Minikube, Helm, and HPA configuration.
Helm chart for deploying the dummy microservice.
Kubernetes manifests for configuring the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.
A report summarizing the testing results and any observations made during the HPA configuration within the Terraform environment.
